## NOTE

I am submitting this project to siege, and this project fulfills the requirement of having working coin system. I also spent 10+ hours into it. The project currently doesnot deliver its full potential, but still at this phase, it can be used and can be quite useful. The main functionality of this application is flashcard playing system, but due to time constraints, i wasn't able to fulfill it. 

However, the create page works great, and due to AI feature and import export feature, it can be great for researching or generating educative contents.
