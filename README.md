## Version 1 (Week 5)

I am submitting this project to siege, and this project fulfills the requirement of having working coin system. I also spent 10+ hours into it. The project currently doesnot deliver its full potential, but still at this phase, it can be used and can be quite useful. The main functionality of this application is flashcard playing system, but due to time constraints, i wasn't able to fulfill it. 

However, the create page works great, and due to AI feature and import export feature, it can be great for researching or generating educative contents.

## Updates (Week 6)

I am submitting this project to siege, and this project fulfills the requirement of having working magic theme. I also spent 10+ hours into it. The project currently is playable, enjoyable and kindof deliver its full potential except an easter egg i planned and review mode. It can be used by kids, students, adults for having both study and fun. 

Next week, my goals will be to fulfill the theme of next week, complete easter egg, complete review system, add a shop, and maybe add real authentication system
